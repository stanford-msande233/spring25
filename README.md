# MS&E 233: Game Theory, Data Science and AI

Course page: [https://stanford-msande233.github.io/spring24/](https://stanford-msande233.github.io/spring24/)

The course will explore applied topics at the intersection of game theory, data science and artificial intelligence. The first part of the course will focus on computational approaches to solving complex games, with applications in developing successful algorithmic agents and explore recent successes in the games such as Go, Stratego and Poker. The lectures will provide the foundations of the methods that underlie these computational game theory methods (rooted in the theory of learning in games) and the assignments will explore implementation of simple variants. The second part of the course will explore the interplay between data science and mechanism design. We will overview topics such as optimizing auctions and mechanisms from data and explore applications in optimizing online auction markets. We will also overview methodologies for learning structural parameters in games and econometrics in games and how these can be used to analyze data that stem from strategic interactions, such as auction data. The third part of the course will explore topics that relate to deploying machine learning and data science pipelines in the presence of strategic behavior. Topics will include A/B testing in markets, with applications to A/B testing on digital platforms such as Uber, Amazon and other matching platforms.
